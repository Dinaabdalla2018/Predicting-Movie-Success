# Predicting-Movie-Success

Using Machine Learning models What can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there 
certain countries that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films 
costing over $100 million to produce can still flop, this question is more important 
than ever to the industry. Can we predict which films will be highly rated?
Using machine learning models we classify different movies.
